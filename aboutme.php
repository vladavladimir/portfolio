<h1 class="h1">Hello, let me introduce myself to you I am Vladimir Markovic.</h1>
<img src="images/Screenshot_20200729_172236.jpg" alt="img" class="me">
<p class="a">I was born in the suburbs of the city of Belgrade-Serbia, municipality
    <a href="https://sh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batajnica">Zemun-Batajnica</a> I was born on December 3.12.1987.
    I grew up there and finished elementary school <a href="http://ospinkibatajnica.nasaskola.rs/">"Bosko Palkovljevic Pinki"</a>, as an excellent student.
    After finishing primary school, I enrolled in a three-year high school <a href="http://gradjevinska.edu.rs/">Gradjevinsku skolu</a> direction Elektroinstalater,
    that was in 2001.
    Then, as a reward for finishing school, I got my first computer from my parents, and since then my love for electronics and computers has been born.
    At first it was more of a love for gaming during high school.
    When I finished high school as a very good student, I enrolled in part-time and four-year high Construction School
    direction Civil Engineering Technician. At that time interest in pc gaming slowly began to change into interest
    how games are made, how websites are made. It was all still on the level of a hobby and some self-research.
    After finishing high school I start working in a company <a href="http://www.marconio.com/">"Michel d.o.o"</a> where I worked for a year as
    a probationary worker,
    to eventually receive me permanently. With the success of permanent employment, I treated myself and finished driving licence for the "B" category,
    that was in 2006.
    The company is engaged in the production of Jacuzzi tubs, where I participated in all production processes. From initial to final and even to
    field installations themselves. Everything was ok. And then came the world economic crisis and where I was the youngest worker in the company I was
    dismissed as a technological surplus due to a reduction in the volume of work. Affected by the loss of my job, I decide to serve in the army
    which was then still mandatory and lasted for six months. Firmly determined to complete my commitment to the state, and
     not to be taken care by parents. And so in September 2009 I went to the army as an infantry in Valjevo.
    I served there for a month and a half, after which, due to the height of 190 cm(6'3ft) and 100 kg(220lbs), I was transferred to Belgrade in
    <a href="http://www.vs.rs/sr_lat/jedinice/vojska-srbije/garda">"Garda"</a>.I spent the remaining four and a half months there.
    I finish my military service in March 2010 and apply for a professional soldier. Started working as a professional soldier
    September 2010. After 3 years of dedicated work, I start attending several military courses and schools.
    All this results in me becoming a non-commissioned officer in december 2015. I continued my military training through further military courses and schools
    where I achieved the best results.</p>

<p class="a"> In 2018 I meet my better half,my wife Maria and in May 2019 I marry her, the happiest day of my life. </p>

<p class="a"> All that time I was still finding time for gaming and some kind of learning and interest in programming. Until 2020 when I decided
    to pay more attention to programming. After some research and information, I decide to start on my own
    to see how it goes. I start with HTML5 and CSS3. I study through <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">"Codecademy"</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">"W3schools"</a>.
    Here I learn the first concepts of programming
    and I wrote the first lines of code. At first it was difficult and unreasonable, but with perseverance I made something that looks like a website. After that I continue
    further by discovering a learning site<a href="https://laracasts.com/">"Laracast"</a> where I pay the subscription and learn PHP, OOP, GIT, MySQL and laravel freamwork.
    Learning progresses and after attending several courses with the I hade a desire to test my knowledge, I pay for the first course on the site
    <a href="https://www.thecampster.com/rs/">"Kampster"</a>. Here I upgraded my knowledge and successfully master test after test and task after task.With previous knowledge
    and with help of <a href="https://www.google.rs/">"Google"</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">"Stack owerflov"</a> I manage to remove all ambiguities and obstacles.</p>
<img src="images/Final2.png" alt="img" class="f2">
<p class="a">The road to knowledge was not easy, there were often days when
    nothing went but persistence, perseverance, desire helped me find out, solve and complete the tasks. Is this knowledge
    enough and complete, certainly not. But it is a beginner-junior knowledge, with the desire and will for further improvement and upgrade.
    And so we come to this website-portfolio, which is a story about me and my current knowledge where I use all my knowledge and skill
     to show the future employer that I am someone who wants to learn and work. It is some of my desire and love from before
    which I now want to fulfill and realize in the world of programming. Iâ€™m 32 now, and I want to try my hand at programming
    to find my place in the IT sector. I also like to read books in my free time, I adore Stephen King and I have about 20 of his
    book. I watch movies of all genres, I listen to music, I like to train, I play games, I love cars, I am also a great gourmet and I know
    to prepare many meals. I like staying in nature, walking by the river.
